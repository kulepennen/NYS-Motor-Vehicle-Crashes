# NYS-Motor-Vehicle-Crashes
A small Udacity student project looking at vehicle crash data for the state of New York

## Installation
This project was completed in a Jupyter Notebook run via Anaconda, using Python v.3.6

## Motivation
This project is part of a Data Scientist Nanodegree at Udacity. The goal of the project is to pick a dataset of own choice and create a blog post addressing a non-technical audience with some discussions and findings after having analyzed the data. Three or more questions shall be posed and answered. The data gathering; preparations, analysis and visualizations is done in a Jupyter notebook.

## Summary
The conclusion of this small analysis is really that the quality of the dataset is a bit poor to start with, and that it probably can be improved. Apart from this, we have found the most common action prior to accident, that Fords crash more ofthen during Police pursuits and that we can't say BMW-drivers don't use the blinkers.

## Files
The detailed analysis made in this project can be found in the attached Jupyter notebook. 

The data files are to big to be uploaded to GITHUB
Data, column descriptions as well as a general description of the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-state/nys-motor-vehicle-crashes-and-insurance-reduction
The dataset used is the: "motor-vehicle-crashes-vehicle-information-three-year-window.csv", consisting of 1.65m rows * 19 columns
